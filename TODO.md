# Scheduling Is Hard TODO

- [ ] Move generateId to a common utility
- [ ] Similar to the host page, make sure the guest page has a warning that their link can be edited by anyone so treat it as a secret!
- [ ] Double check there's parity between the OpenAPI spec and routes. Please update and clean up anything as necessary. Especially check if there's anything unused.
- [ ] Go through all the css files and tsx files and make sure we're appropriately using "rem" instead of "em". Also please clean up and unnecessary or redundant css styles and classes. Consolidate where appropriate.
- [ ] There should be a way to filter guests by name on the mutual calendar
- [ ] Idea: is there a way to make an open invite link to poll tons of people?
