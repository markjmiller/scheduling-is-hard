# Scheduling Is Hard TODO

- [ ] Clean up any unnecessary debug logging.
- [ ] Change: guests and hosts should be able to change their name whenever they want. Also host should be able to edit their name from the host page.
- [ ] Once you click "I am not available for any dates", it should stay toggled until you click some date cells.
- [ ] If the event has an unknown number of guests, the # of respondents should just show "# responded" instead of "# of unknown (expected) responded"
- [ ] Implement the generate guest link functionality from the host page.
